Analysis done on the earnings of data science techies round the world.
Data science is a profession birthed out of statistics to help in predicting the likelihood of an occurence to happen or not to happen. According to analysis, since 2012, there has been a tremendous increase of 650% in the available roles for the data science professionals, and from the US bureau of statistics, there will be an expected increase of about 27.9% for the demand of the skills by 2026.

This analysis was carried out on 607 data of different companies from 50 countries around the world, with a total of 12 features, describing each of the data.

From the analysis, I was able to discover that of the 50 countries, the United States of America is the country with more companies employing the skills of data scientists with 355 inputs, while the United Kingdom, which comes after the USA has only 47 companies utilizing the skills of data scientists according to the data.![download](https://github.com/psalmsen/Data-Science-Salaries/assets/126109564/928e126e-87b2-455c-84ca-5e64562aadd7). In the same way, majority of the data scientist are resident in the United State (332 persons)![download](https://github.com/psalmsen/Data-Science-Salaries/assets/126109564/99b365c3-81ca-42cb-913c-581e44d7d532)

Analysis was also carried out on the job roles opened to the data scientists. Of all the 50 different job roles available, the role of data scientist, data engineer, data analyst, machine learning engineer and the research scientist are the top 5 roles that are in demand for data scientists.![download](https://github.com/psalmsen/Data-Science-Salaries/assets/126109564/4929694a-ae93-4105-925d-37d062e63a5a)

To excel in this career, experience matters and companies prefer to go for what will be profitable for them, hence, making the senior level expereienced techies (46.1%) largely opened to employment followed by the mid leevel techies (35.1%) and the experts the least (4.3%).![download](https://github.com/psalmsen/Data-Science-Salaries/assets/126109564/1dea6209-b941-4112-a1bd-c5174420102e)
 The question is why are the experts the least? This because they mostly hold key positions like director and lead roles which is always minute.


Data scientists enjoy the ability to control there time as mostly they land jobs that could be done remotely. But according to this data, there are some 'buts', i.e, in some cases you might be needed on-site or once in a while on-site. Accoding to this data, if you are interested of working remotely, been a contractor guarantees you that, and also, been a full-timer, you have a 70% of working remotely compared to other employment type.![download](https://github.com/psalmsen/Data-Science-Salaries/assets/126109564/717b7862-b1e7-4ddb-af18-942b91663698)
